## This project is still a WIP

## Still many bugs, especially with the modals not closing. I tried taking an original design and using elements from templates I could find online. Didn't use bootstrap for this one to try to challenge myself, making everything a little bit harder.

## EDIT 11/26/19 - Fixed Modals, and some bugs with misnaming the github project URL's. Site is running smoothly now, and I will keep adding my better projects as I complete them in the bootcamp.
